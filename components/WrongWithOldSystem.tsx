          <p>Washing machines are unable to remove microbes in fabrics.</p>
          <p>
            Fabric sanitizers cannot fully kill all germs, prevent their growth on clean clothes, or stop them from
            contaminating your skin.
          </p>
          <p>Cleansers don't remove microbes lodged inside your pores.</p>
          <p>Deodorants, even natural ones, clog your pores and trap microbes inside.</p>
          <p>The real problem is not your body â€” it's your system.</p>
          <p>
            Fabrics can introduce harmful microbes to your skin daily, particularly when you dry off with a contaminated
            towel or wear clothes carrying microbes. Your system keeps you in an endless unhealthy cycle, dependent on
            products that block pores, kill bacteria, and mask the problem with fragrances.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over time, this damages your skin's appearance, natural smell, protective barrier, sensory receptors,
            hormones and increases your sweat production. You shouldn't have to compromise your health for freshness.
          </p>
          <p>When you break this cycle, you start working with your body, not against it.</p>
