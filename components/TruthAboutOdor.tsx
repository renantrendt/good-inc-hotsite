            Rather than relying on temporary fixes, by understanding how odor develops and recognizing the role clothing
            plays in perpetuating it, you can address the root cause and take control of your health.
          </p>
          <p>
            Body odor begins when bacteria is transferred to your skin from contaminated clothing - whether that be from
            shared garments, or clothing washed in machines that harbor resilient strains capable of surviving high
            temperatures and chemicals that would typically eliminate other strains.
          </p>
          <p>
            Traditional deodorants trap bacteria in pores, disrupting hormonal balance. In response, the body increases
            sweat production to clear the pores. These deodorant residues, along with bacteria are transferred back to
            clothing. Without natural predators on the fabric fibers, bacteria thrive by forming durable biofilms that
            are nearly impossible to remove after some hours of wear, perpetuating an unhealthy cycle of skin
            recontamination.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bacteria can adapt to chemicals, including antibiotics, within days. This means that merely trying to switch
            between deodorants to kill bacteria is not a healthy solution. Instead, the focus should shift to
            identifying and eliminating the root source of contamination: clothing.
