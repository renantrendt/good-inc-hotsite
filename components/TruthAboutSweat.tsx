            Sweat is vital to our body's cooling system, but using products to manage sweat and odor can have hidden
            consequences. Balancing sweat management with maintaining the body's natural ability to regulate temperature
            is essential for overall health.

          <p>
            When the body's primary sweat zones are blocked by deodorants, antiperspirants, bacteria and residues, the
            lymphatic system becomes overloaded, forcing sweat to redirect to less common areas like the back, forehead,
            hands, groin, and feet.

            This disruption is much like a computer's cooling system failing â€” causing the brain, our "processor," to
            overheat. The effects include diminished mental capacity, heightened anxiety, and slowed cognitive
            functions, highlighting the deep connection between physical and mental health.
