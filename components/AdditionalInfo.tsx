            If you are experiencing skin odor or intimate problems, it is recommended that you treat your fabrics with
            hydrogen peroxide and hot water for 5 minutes then manually scrub the affected part of the fabric. Finish by
            washing it on a heavy cycle with hot water to sanitize.

          <p>If the issue persists, consider discarding the garment.</p>
